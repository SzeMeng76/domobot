### üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

#### Core Components

1.  **Main Application** (`main.py`): Handles async initialization, dependency injection, and lifecycle management.
2.  **Command Modules** (`commands/`): Each service has its own module, registered via a factory pattern with permission control.
3.  **Utility Modules** (`utils/`):
- `config_manager.py`: Configuration management.
- `cache_manager.py`, `redis_cache_manager.py`: Cache management.
- `mysql_user_manager.py`: Database operations for users and permissions.
- `task_scheduler.py`, `redis_task_scheduler.py`: Task scheduling.
- `permissions.py`: Permission system.
4.  **Data Storage:**
- **Redis:** Caching and message deletion scheduling.
- **MySQL:** User data and permission management.

#### Key Design Patterns

- **Command Factory:** For unified command registration and permission handling.
- **Dependency Injection:** Core components are passed via `bot_data`.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Fully supports `async/await` for all I/O operations.
- **Decorator-based Error Handling:** Unified error handling for commands.
- **Direct Async Permission Checks:** The complex adapter layer has been removed, and MySQL operations are now directly asynchronous.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

- `users`: Basic user information
- `admin_permissions`: Administrators
- `super_admins`: Super administrators
- `user_whitelist`: Whitelisted users
- `group_whitelist`: Whitelisted groups
- `admin_logs`: Administrator action logs
- `command_stats`: Command usage statistics

The schema is defined in `database/init.sql` and is created automatically by the application on first run.

### üîê Permissions System

#### Architectural Optimizations

The project has been fully migrated away from SQLite compatibility adapters to a unified MySQL + Redis architecture:

- **Direct Asynchronous Permission Checks:** `utils/permissions.py` directly fetches the MySQL manager from `context.bot_data['user_cache_manager']`.
- **Unified Data Storage:** All permission data is stored in MySQL, preventing inconsistencies.
- **Performance Improvements:** The removal of synchronous-to-asynchronous complexities has increased response speed.

#### Permission Levels

1.  **Public Access:** All users and groups (whitelisted or not) can access streaming service pricing (`/nf`, `/ds`, `/sp`) and user information commands (`/when`, `/id`). Simply add the bot to any group to enable these features.
2.  **Whitelist Access:** Required for advanced features like crypto prices, currency conversion, weather forecasts, Steam prices, BIN lookup, and app store queries. *Whitelist applications are currently closed - future paid service plans may be available.*
3.  **Admin:** Stored in the MySQL `admin_permissions` table.
4.  **Super Admin:** Configured via the `SUPER_ADMIN_ID` environment variable.

### üß© Extending the Bot

#### Custom Scripts

Place Python scripts in the `custom_scripts/` directory and set `LOAD_CUSTOM_SCRIPTS=true` to load them automatically. Scripts get access to:

- `application`: The Telegram Application instance.
- `cache_manager`: The Redis cache manager.
- `rate_converter`: The currency converter.
- `user_cache_manager`: The user cache manager.
- `stats_manager`: The statistics manager.

#### New Command Development

1.  Create a new module in the `commands/` directory.
2.  Use `command_factory.register_command()` to register the new command.
3.  Set the appropriate permission level.
4.  Inject any necessary dependencies in `main.py`.

### üìä Logging & Monitoring

#### Log Management

- **Log File:** `logs/bot-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **Log Rotation:** 10MB size limit with 5 backups.
- **Log Levels:** Supports `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.
- **Periodic Cleanup:** Via `cleanup_logs.py` or a scheduled task.

#### Monitoring Features

- Command usage statistics
- User activity monitoring
- Error logging
- Performance metric collection

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

#### Caching Strategy

- **Redis Cache:** Used for high-frequency data like price information and weather location lookups.
- **Unified Cache Management:** Managed via `redis_cache_manager.py`.
- **Smart Caching:** Different services have configurable cache durations.

#### Task Scheduling

- **Redis Task Scheduler:** Supports scheduled, recurring tasks.
- **Message Deletion:** Automatically cleans up temporary messages.
- **Cache Cleanup:** Periodically purges expired cache.

#### Connection Management

- **Connection Pooling:** Used for both MySQL and Redis.
- **Asynchronous Client:** Uses `httpx` for async HTTP requests.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Cleans up resources and closes connections gracefully.

### üí° Development Best Practices

1.  **Error Handling:** Use the `@with_error_handling` decorator.
2.  **Logging:** Use appropriate log levels.
3.  **Permission Checks:** Use the `@require_permission(...)` decorator.
4.  **Async Permissions:** Fetch the user manager via `context.bot_data['user_cache_manager']`.
5.  **Caching:** Use Redis caching to avoid duplicate requests.
6.  **Async Code:** Use `async/await` for all I/O-bound operations.
7.  **Configuration:** Manage all settings via environment variables.
8.  **Database Queries:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1.  **Database Connection Failure:** Check MySQL configuration and connection.
2.  **Redis Connection Failure:** Check Redis service status.
3.  **Permission Errors:** Ensure the user is in the whitelist or admin list.
4.  **Commands Not Responding:** Check the log file for errors.
5.  **Weather Command Fails:** Ensure the `QWEATHER_API_KEY` is set correctly in your `.env` file and that it's a valid key.
6.  **BIN Lookup Fails:** Ensure the `BIN_API_KEY` is set correctly in your `.env` file and that you have sufficient API quota.

#### Debugging Tips

1.  Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for detailed logs.
2.  Use `docker-compose logs -f appbot` to view real-time logs.
3.  Check Redis cache status.
4.  Verify database table structure and data.

### üìú Architecture Migration Notes (v2.0 - Latest)

**Removed Components:**
